              I've always been fascinated by the way technology can enhance life,
              be it through making life easier or more exciting. I've collaborated with
              others to create various digital products in the form of games and apps,
              with the goal of creating unique experiences that are accessible to as many
              people as possible. I'm a problem solver, a quick learner and working on 
              improving myself one step at a time.

            At the start of the pandemic, I brought together a group of trusted friends
            to make games. We're called Counter Tempo Studios. It was a name chosen 
            to represent the kind of games we wanted to make. One's that were unqiue 
            and different from industry direction. One of those differences being a
            focus on accessiblity.
